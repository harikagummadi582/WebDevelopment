            <h1>How to Play Battleship</h1>
            <p>Battleship is a strategy game played between two players. Each player places their ships on a grid and takes turns guessing the location of their opponent's ships.</p>
            
            <h2>Game Setup</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Each player arranges their ships on a 10x10 grid.</li>
                <li>All the ships are of same size.</li>
                <li>Players cannot see their opponent's ships.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Players take turns guessing where the ship might be.</li>
                <li>If the opponent has a ship in that position, it is marked as a "hit".</li>
                <li>If there is no ship, it is marked as a "miss".</li>
                <li>A ship is sunk when all its tiles are hit.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
            <p>The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game!</p>
