# Battleship Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleship game, built using HTML and CSS. The game layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring it adapts well to both desktop and mobile devices. 

## Challenges
**What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?**
The most challenging aspect was likely handling the responsive design for mobile devices, especially ensuring that the game's layout adapts well to smaller screens.

**Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?**
Working with HTML and CSS was relatively straightforward. CSS styling, especially the positioning and grid layouts, provided some challenge when trying to make the layout responsive. Flexbox and Grid were particularly useful.

## Time Taken
**How long did this overall assignment take you?**
This assignment took approximately 20 hours to complete, including planning, coding, and adjustments.

## Mobile-Friendly Decisions
**What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?**
I used media queries to adjust layout changes such as grid size and navbar formatting. Additionally, I ensured that elements like text and navbar remain legible and usable on smaller screens by adjusting padding and font sizes. I also had to look into the adjustment of all the elements for mobile friendly design.

## Design Considerations
**What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?**
I focused on making the website visually engaging and easy to navigate. I’m particularly proud of the layout for the game boards and the smooth transition effects on hover. I also liked the mobile responsiveness, which adapts the layout to small screens effectively.

## Future Features
**Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?**
If I had more time, I would consider adding a real-time multiplayer feature for the game, implementing more detailed animations, and adding sound effects to enhance user experience. And to add more features to engage the users and few more su=ound and visual effects wherever necessary. Chatbot as well.

## Time Spent
**How many hours did you spend on this assignment?**
The total time spent on the assignment was approximately 20 hours.

## Assumptions
**(Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?**
I assumed that the game would be a single-player interface for visualizing the Battleship game without complex logic or AI opponent implementation. so i didnt have to complicate features while adding. I assumed its a beginner friendly game. I assumed it should look simple and neat.

## Resources
**If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here.**
I used [mention any resources like a CSS framework, Google Fonts, or tutorials]. Additionally, the styling for the navbar and game boards was influenced by best practices for grid layouts and mobile-first design.
